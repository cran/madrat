\usage{
calcOutput(type, aggregate = TRUE, file = NULL, years = NULL,
  round = NULL, supplementary = FALSE, append = FALSE,
  na_warning = TRUE, try = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{output type, e.g. "TauTotal". A list of all available source
types can be retrieved with function \code{\link{getCalculations}}.}

\item{aggregate}{Boolean indicating whether output data aggregation should be performed or not, "GLO" (or "glo") for aggregation to one global region,
"REG+GLO" (or "regglo") for a combination of regional and global data.}

\item{file}{A file name. If given the output is written to that file in the
outputfolder as specified in the config.}

\item{years}{A vector of years that should be returned. If set to NULL all
available years are returned.}

\item{round}{A rounding factor. If set to NULL no rounding will occur.}

\item{supplementary}{boolean deciding whether supplementary information such as weight should be
returned or not. If set to TRUE a list of elements will be returned!}

\item{append}{boolean deciding whether the output data should be appended in the existing file.
Works only when a file name is given in the function call.}

\item{na_warning}{boolean deciding whether NAs in the data set should create a warning or not}

\item{try}{if set to TRUE the calculation will only be tried and the script will continue even if
the underlying calculation failed. If set to TRUE calculation will stop with an error in such a 
case.}

\item{...}{Additional settings directly forwarded to the corresponding
calculation function}
}
\value{
magpie object with the requested output data either on country or on
regional level depending on the choice of argument "aggregate" or a list of information
if supplementary is set to TRUE.
}
\description{
Calculate a specific output for which a calculation function exists package. The function is a
wrapper for specific functions designed for the different possible output types.
}
\note{
The underlying calc-functions are required to provide a list of information back to 
\code{calcOutput}. Following list entries should be provided:
\itemize{
\item x - the data itself as magclass object
\item weight - a weight for the spatial aggregation
\item unit - unit of the provided data
\item description - a short description of the data
\item note (optional) - additional notes related to the data
\item isocountries (optional | default = TRUE (mostly) or FALSE (if global)) - a boolean
indicating whether data is in iso countries or not (the latter will deactivate several 
features such as aggregation)
\item mixed_aggregation (optional | default = FALSE) - boolean which allows for mixed 
aggregation (weighted mean mixed with summations). If set to TRUE weight columns 
filled with NA will lead to summation, otherwise they will trigger an error.
\item min (optional) - Minimum value which can appear in the data. If provided calcOutput
will check whether there are any values below the given threshold and warn in this case
\item max (optional) - Maximum value which can appear in the data. If provided calcOutput
will check whether there are any values above the given threshold and warn in this case
\item aggregationFunction (optional | default = toolAggregate) - Function to be used to 
aggregate data from country to regions. The function must have the argument \code{x} for 
the data itself and \code{rel} for the relation mapping between countries and regions and 
must return the data as magpie object in the spatial resolution as defined in rel.
\item aggregationArguments (optional) - List of additional, named arguments to be supplied 
to the aggregation function. In addition to the arguments set here, the function will be 
supplied with the arguments \code{x}, \code{rel} and if provided/deviating from the default
also \code{weight} and \code{mixed_aggregation}.
